# museum-nextjs-search

Powerful platforms like [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) & [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) make it possible for museums to easily build performant, responsive and accessible faceted searches for their online collections.

## Demo

This project has been deployed on Vercel at https://bkm-next-search.vercel.app/

OpenAI CLIP Embeddings similarity feature is in the [feature-experimental-clip](https://github.com/derekphilipau/museum-nextjs-search/tree/feature-experimental-clip) branch.  The embeddings were slowing down my test Elasticsearch instance, so I've taken down the Vercel deployment.  [You can see examples of artwork similarity here.](./doc/embeddings.md)

## Overview

A typical approach for building a collections website is to periodically sync data from a backend collections management system (sometimes augmented with data from an internal CMS) into a relational database which is queried by a frontend website.

This project takes a different approach, using Elasticsearch as the primary data store and Next.js as the frontend. Note that the collections data is read-only, the actual datastore is in the backend system. Using the last exported files, the Elasticsearch indices can be rebuilt within a handful of minutes, even with collections of 200,000 documents.

TODO: Implement the "Cloud Function Periodic Sync" using AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions. For the time being, Elasticsearch indices are updated manually via command line scripts.

### Importing data

Two methods are offered for updating indices: Update and insert.

![Loading data with Update and Insert methods](./doc/img/UpdateInsertIndex.png)

#### Update Method

The update method loads data from a JSONL file and updates documents in an index. If the document doesn't already exist, it is created. Document fields are updated with new information, but fields not contained in the data file are not updated. For example, the image.dominantColor field is not present in the original data file, as it is populated by another script, so that information is preserved across updates. Note that it may be necessary to force an update of calculated fields, for example if the primary image of an object has changed. Also note that approach will fail for nested fields.

#### Insert method

The insert method completely repopulates an index from a JSONL data file. To avoid any downtime, first a timestamped index is created and populated, then the alias is pointed at the newly-created index. This will completely rebuild an index with each sync, and any calculated field values will be lost.

## Datasets

### Collections Data

All data was collected via the [Brooklyn Museum Open API](https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/api/docs).

### Archives Data

The Archives data was collected using the OAI-PMH harvesting API of Brooklyn Museum's [ArchivesSpace](https://archivesspace.org/) service.

The Dublin Core metadata is limited. It would be better to use ArchivesSpace's native API to index all the metadata fields like Language, Type, Names, etc.

### Additional Metadata

It's often necessary to augment backend collection data with additional metadata.  For example, theme tags like "Climate Justice" might be associated with artworks in a CMS rather the backend collections management system.  The "sortPriority" field allows one to prominently display specific documents by adjusting the ordering in default searches.  This additional metadata is stored in `data/BrooklynMuseum/additionalMetadata.jsonl`, but could just as easily be exported from a CMS.

### Getty Union List of Artist Names (ULAN) Data

ULAN XML was downloaded from [Getty's website](http://ulandownloads.getty.edu/) and converted to JSON using the `ulanXmlToJsonConvert.ts` script. When updating the `terms` index, the script attempts to find a matching artist name from this JSON file. If found, the ULAN artist data is added to the terms index document.

## Elasticsearch

### Elasticsearch DSL

This project uses Elasticsearch [Query DSL](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl.html) with the Elasticsearch [Javascript Client](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/index.html) to manage indices and query data.

### Elasticsearch Field Types

Basic Elasticsearch index, field types, analyzers, and filters are defined in `util/elasticsearch/settings.ts`.

### Index Definition

Adjust number_of_shards and number_of_replicas for your use case.

#### Analyzers & Filters

[Mapping Character Filters](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-mapping-charfilter.html):

- `hyphenApostropheMappingFilter` - replaces hyphens with spaces and removes single quotes.
- `articleCharFilter` - UNUSED - replaces common articles (de, van, der, etc.) with spaces. Originally intended to help with searching names containing many articles.

[Filters](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-tokenfilters.html):

- `enSnowball` - stems words using a [Snowball-generated stemmer](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-snowball-tokenfilter.html) for English language

[Analyzers](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analyzer.html):

- `unaggregatedStandardAnalyzer` - For common text fields that are not aggregated.
- `aggregatedKeywordAnalyzer` - For aggregated keyword fields
- `suggestAnalyzer` - For search_as_you_type fields

#### Field definitions

Most definitions are straight-forward. Some search and suggest fields contain subfields "search" and "suggest" used for those use-cases.

### Elasticsearch Indices

Indices are defined in `/util/elasticsearch/indices.ts`.

### Re-used Object Fields

Some object fields are re-used across multiple indices.

Constituent:

- `id` - Source-dependent ID of the constituent
- `name` - Name of the constituent, e.g. "Pablo Picasso"

### Elasticsearch Queries

##### Multi-match Search

Text queries are currently searched with multi_match default [`best_fields`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-multi-match-query.html). Fields can be weighted to give priority, in this case `boostedKeywords` is very heavily weighted for cases where you want a document to appear first if it contains an important keyword.

```
multi_match: {
    query: q,
    type: 'best_fields',
    operator: 'and',
    fields: [
        'boostedKeywords^20',
        'constituents^4', // TODO
        'title^2',
        'keywords^2',
        'description',
        'searchText',
        'accessionNumber',
    ],
},
```

#### Collection Object Similarity

How one defines object similarity will vary from institution to institution. There are a number of approaches to querying Elasticsearch for similar documents, notably [`more_like_this`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-mlt-query.html).

This project uses a custom bool query of boosted should terms. [similarObjects.ts](./util/elasticsearch/search/similarObjects.ts) specifies which fields are used along with a boost value for each. The primary constituent (e.g. Artist, Maker, etc.) is given the most weight. These fields can be adjusted based on your institution's concept of object similarity. The current weights are:

- `primaryConstituent.canonicalName` - 4
- `dynasty` - 2
- `period` - 2
- `classification` - 1.5
- `medium` - 1
- `departments` - 1
- `exhibitions` - 1
- `primaryGeographicalLocation.name` - 1

## Experimental Features

I've added CLIP Embeddings but there's no code in this project to add embeddings yourself. I've used [the code here](https://github.com/derekphilipau/elastic-clip-museum-search) to add the embeddings via a Colab notebook, but it's a hack. Removed. [See examples here.](./doc/embeddings.md)

## Adopt it yourself

It's hoped that all one will need to do is be able to export TMS data to JSON matching the format of the Elasticsearch index.

## API Endpoints

### Search API

Searches can be performed against any index. Search requests are of the form:
GET `http://localhost:3000/api/search/[index]?[querystring]`

Querystring parameters are the same as those for the Web UI:
GET `http://localhost:3000/api/search/collections?f=true&.name=George%20Bradford%20Brainerd`

### Document API

Document requests are of the form:
GET `http://localhost:3000/api/[index]/[documentId]`

For example, to get collection object #53453:
GET `http://localhost:3000/api/collections/53453`

## Installation & Running

### Set up Elasticsearch

You can run Elasticsearch in a Docker container, or sign up for an Elasticsearch Cloud account. [For Docker, follow the instructions here.](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.6/docker.html) [Sign up for an Elasticsearch Cloud account here.](https://cloud.elastic.co/)

### Environment Variables

Once you have a running Elasticsearch service, you can add the connection details to the environment variables.

For local development, add a local `.env.local` file in the root directory. If `ELASTICSEARCH_USE_CLOUD` is "true", the Elastic Cloud vars will be used, otherwise the \_HOST, \_PROTOCOL, \_PORT, \_CA_FILE, and \_API_KEY vars will be used. You may need to copy the http_ca.crt from the Elasticsearch Docker container to a local directory like `./secrets`.

On [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) you should set up a basic contact form and enter the `FORMSPREE_FORM_ID` env variable.

For cloud deployments (for example on Vercel), add the same variables to the Environment Variables of your deployment.

```
DATASET=brooklynMuseum
ELASTICSEARCH_USE_CLOUD=true
ELASTICSEARCH_CLOUD_ID=elastic-museum-test:dXMtY2VudlasfdkjfdwLmNsb3VkLmVzLmlvOjQ0MyQ5ZDhiNWQ2NDM0NTA0ODgwadslfjk;ldfksjfdlNmE2M2IwMmaslfkjfdlksj2ZTU5MzZmMg==
ELASTICSEARCH_CLOUD_USERNAME=elastic
ELASTICSEARCH_CLOUD_PASSWORD=aslflsafdkjlkjslakdfj
ELASTICSEARCH_HOST=localhost
ELASTICSEARCH_PROTOCOL=https
ELASTICSEARCH_PORT=9200
ELASTICSEARCH_CA_FILE=./secrets/http_ca.crt
ELASTICSEARCH_API_KEY=DssaSLfdsFKJidsljfakslfjfLIJEWLiMkJPQzNwSzVmQQ==
ELASTICSEARCH_BULK_LIMIT=1000
FORMSPREE_FORM_ID=mskbksar
```

### Download & Install

Fork/download this project and run `npm i` to install dependencies.

Then, run the development server with `npm run dev` and open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

If you have not yet loaded the Elasticsearch data, you should see an error on the search page that the index does not exist.

### Loading the data

From the command line, run: `npm run import`

The main data file with collection objects is `./data/BrooklynMuseum/collections.jsonl.gz`. `importDataCommand.ts` will load compressed data from .jsonl.gz files in the `data/BrooklynMuseum/` directory into Elasticsearch indices. **_Warning: This will modify Elasticsearch indices._**

This command will:

1. Load environment variables from `.env.local`
2. Ask if you want to proceed with the import
3. Ask if you want to import the collections index (all records)
4. Ask if you want to import the content index (all records)
5. Ask if you want to import the archives index (all records)
6. Ask if you want to update the terms index. Queries collections index for collections, classifications, and primaryConstituent fields, then adds unique values to the terms index.
7. Ask if you want to update the ULAN terms index. Queries collections index for all unique primaryConstituent values, then searches ULAN data files for each name. If a match is found, ULAN data is added to the term.
8. Ask if you want to update dominant colors. This will only update colors for images which haven't already been analyzed.

The import process will take some time, as it inserts 1000 documents at a time using Elasticsearch bulk and then rests for a couple seconds. There are about 100,000 documents in the collections dataset, 800 in content, and 31,000 in the archives dataset.
